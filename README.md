# Spigot plugin runCmd
Minecraft Spigot plugin to run commands in-game on server machine.

# Compatibility
This plugin was made with spigot 1.16.5 in mind, but it doesn't use any spigot-only funcionality, so it should work on any bukkit fork.

Tested only in minecraft 1.16.5 but should work in other versions since it doesn't do anything version-specific

# Download
You can download the built jar in the [releases page](https://github.com/daviirodrig/runCmd/releases)
